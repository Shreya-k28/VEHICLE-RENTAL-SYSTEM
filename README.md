Vehicle Rental System
This project implements a simple Vehicle Rental System using Java Swing. The system allows users to rent vehicles for a given number of days and calculates the rental cost based on the vehicle type. Users can also return the vehicle, and the system will display the confirmation along with the total rental cost.

Features
Vehicle Rental: Users can select a vehicle and input the number of days they want to rent it.
Price Calculation: The system calculates the total rental cost based on the vehicle and the number of rental days.
Vehicle Return: Users can return the vehicle and receive a confirmation message.
Reset Option: Users can reset all input fields.
Error Handling: The application checks for invalid inputs and provides appropriate messages to guide users.
Vehicles and Pricing
Toyota Corolla: $50.0/day
Honda Civic: $60.0/day
Ford Mustang: $100.0/day

Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or above
IDE:  Eclipse, or any Java-compatible IDE

Installation
1. Clone the Repository
   GIT CLONE : https://github.com/Shreya-k28/VEHICLE-RENTAL-SYSTEM/blob/main/code%20of%20vehicle%20rental%20system
    


3. Compile and Run
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
Compile and run the Demo class to start the application.

4. Run from Command Line
If you're familiar with the command line, navigate to the directory where the files are located and compile and run the program:

javac Demo.java
java Demo
Usage
Enter your name in the corresponding text field.
Enter the number of rental days.
Select a vehicle (Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, or Ford Mustang).
Click the "OK" button to calculate the total rental cost.
Click the "RETURN" button to simulate vehicle return.
Use the "RESET" button to clear all input fields.

Code Explanation
GUI Layout: The GUI is built using Java Swing components such as JLabel, JTextField, and JButton.
Event Handling: The application listens for button clicks (OK, Return, Reset) and performs appropriate actions based on user inputs.
Error Handling: The program ensures that users enter valid values (e.g., a valid number of days).
Price Calculation: When the user selects a vehicle, the application multiplies the rental days by the corresponding price to compute the total cost.
